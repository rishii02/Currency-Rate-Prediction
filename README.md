# Currency-Rate-Prediction
This ML model predicts the future currency exchange rates 
This is the Project for Machine Learning course at Mahindra University. Currency exchange rate prediction is a regression problem in machine learning. There occur changes in return rates every day that influence a business, or can even influence the economy of a country. As a result, forecasting exchange rates can help. Linear Regression, Desicion Tree Regression and Random Forest Regression algorithms were used to predict future currency exchange rates. After analyzing the r2_scores, MAE and other performance metrics Linear Regression gave better predictions than other algorithms.
